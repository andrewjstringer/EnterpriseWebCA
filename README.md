# EnterpriseWebCA
CA front end to openssl for partially automating creating ssl certificates for an organisation's internal use.
The web frontend is responsible for a user uploading a CSR file, the admin is then emailed and must manually approve the CSR before a Cert is issued.
This is a menu driven bash script.
